"""BUG-017: signing out stops the push to that handset, and touches nothing else.

    python server/nigraan_server.py      # in one terminal
    python tests/test_signout_stops_push.py

The bug was that sign-out was entirely local. The phone dropped its session and
the server was never told, so the `devices` row kept the account's user_id and a
live push token -- and every alert to that person's family went on being
delivered to a handset nobody was signed in on, carrying a name and a link to
where somebody is right now.

Two things are worth asserting, and they pull in opposite directions:

  - the token really stops being deliverable, and
  - *nothing else* does. The account, its family and its history are untouched,
    and the next sign-in on the same phone restores delivery with no manual step.

The second is the one worth writing a test for. "Deregister the device" reads
like it deletes something belonging to the user, and the fix is only correct
because it does not.

Whether the token was actually cleared is a fact about the database, not about
any HTTP response, so those checks need DATABASE_URL -- the same value the
server and scripts/push_doctor.py read. Without it they are skipped and said to
be skipped, rather than quietly passing.
