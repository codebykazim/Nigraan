"""U3/U4 server support: check-in payloads, private near-misses, Good Samaritan.

    python server/nigraan_server.py      # in one terminal
    python tests/test_samaritan_and_checkin.py

Three promises the UI is built on top of, checked on the live socket because
that is where the app reads them:

  1. A check-in carries the server's deadline and its own id, so the phone can
     render a real countdown and can answer the buzz it was sent (matrix #15).
  2. A cancelled fall is written down and told to nobody.
  3. A stranger near a severity-5 alert is asked, is told nothing that
     identifies anyone, and gets the name and the exact pin only after saying
     they are going (matrix #20).
