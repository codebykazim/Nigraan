"""BUG-008: the answer to an SOS survives the wearer's app being closed.

    python server/nigraan_server.py      # in one terminal
    python tests/test_responder_restore.py

The bug was that `ctx.responders` could only ever be filled by the live socket's
`ack` frame. A family member who answered while the wearer's app was closed was
recorded in the database and then told to nobody: reopening the app said
"waiting for someone to answer" while somebody was already on their way.

So the thing worth testing is the case the socket does NOT cover. The ward never
connects a socket here -- that is the point. Everything is checked through
`GET /alerts?scope=mine`, which is what the app calls on every cold start and
every return to the foreground.

The push notification that now goes out alongside this is deliberately not
asserted: it leaves the process through Expo, and a test that needed a real
device token would fail for reasons that have nothing to do with this contract.
What is checked is the part the phone reads back.
