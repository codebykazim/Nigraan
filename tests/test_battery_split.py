"""Two batteries, two devices — the server half (migrations 002 and 003).

    python server/nigraan_server.py      # in one terminal
    python tests/test_battery_split.py

Migration 002 gave the family two numbers instead of one. It did not give them
two *devices*: in virtual mode the phone runs the band firmware itself, so it
reports `band_link=true` -- correctly, the gestures work -- while there is no
wristband and no second cell behind it. The family screen then drew a band, and
a band battery, and both were the phone.

And because `band_batt` was written with COALESCE, a null never erased it. Link
a real band once, switch back to the phone, and that band's last reading stayed
on a safety screen for the life of the account, looking live.

So the phone now says which kind of band it has, every heartbeat, and this file
holds the server to the three rules that follow:

  1. a real band's two readings arrive apart and stay apart
  2. a virtual beat clears the band's reading rather than preserving it
  3. an OLD build -- no `virtual` field, no `band_batt` -- still must not erase
     a good reading, which is what COALESCE was there for in the first place

Rule 3 is the negative control. Without it rule 2 could pass by the server
simply throwing band_batt away on every beat, which would break every real
band instead.

What this cannot cover, and what needs a phone (L3): that the wearer's own
screens say N/A rather than showing the phone's charge twice, and that a band
below 20% raises `band_battery` and never `low_battery`.
