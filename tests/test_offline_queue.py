"""The server half of the offline SOS queue (c40a7e0).

    python server/nigraan_server.py      # in one terminal
    python tests/test_offline_queue.py

The queue itself lives on the phone -- AsyncStorage, a reconnect listener, an
amber banner -- and none of that can run here. But when signal returns,
`flushQueue` in nigraan-app/src/alertQueue.js does exactly one thing the
server can see:

    POST /alert  { kind, source, lat, lon, accuracy, note }

...where lat/lon are Point A, the fix taken when the button was pressed, and
the note has "Current location: <Point B>" appended -- where the phone is now.
The server cannot tell that request apart from a button pressed a second ago,
which is the whole design. So what is checkable without a phone is the
contract: when an alert that has been sitting in a queue finally arrives, is
it handled correctly?

What this file does NOT cover, and what still needs two phones (L2):
  - the AsyncStorage entry surviving a cold start
  - the flush firing on the WebSocket rising edge
  - standing down a queued alert dropping the whole queue rather than one item
  - the "Alert saved on this device" banner and the delivery-state copy

OPEN DESIGN QUESTION, pinned by section 2 below: a queued alert is written with
`created_at = time.time()` at arrival, and AlertIn has no field for when the
button was actually pressed. The phone records `queuedAt` and then throws it
away. So an SOS pressed in a dead zone and delivered twenty minutes later
reaches the family stamped "just now". Her own screen counts from the real
press; theirs does not agree. Fixing that is a schema change (a pressed_at on
AlertIn) and a product decision, not a bug to quietly patch here.
