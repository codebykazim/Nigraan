"""The watch_lost rule, every case, in about a hundredth of a second.

    python tests/test_watch_lost_transition.py

No server, no database, no network and no waiting -- unlike the rest of this
suite, which is end-to-end on purpose. That is deliberate too. `watch_lost` is
the alert that pages a whole family about an absence, it is the one the product
is judged on at 2 a.m., and the states that get it wrong are the ones nobody
can stage on a desk: a band that drops in the same second an SOS is pressed, a
phone silent since lunch, a link flapping in a stairwell, a two-minute window
that has to end in a page exactly once.

That last one is why this file matters more than it looks. A grace window is a
promise with a clock on it, and a clock is not something anybody wants to test
by standing in a corridor with a stopwatch. Here it is a number passed to a
function.

Which is why the rule lives in server/watch_lost.py as pure functions. Read
that file first: it states the rule and, more usefully, states which side wins
each race. Everything below is that document turned into assertions.
