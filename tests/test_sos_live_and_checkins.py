"""An SOS that keeps asking, keeps reporting, and can end by being answered.

    python server/nigraan_server.py      # in one terminal
    python tests/test_sos_live_and_checkins.py

Three changes to the emergency path, tested together because they are one flow
and the seams between them are where the bugs live:

  1. A missed HIGH ALERT check-in is an emergency, not a footnote. It used to
     be `checkin_missed` -- severity 3, no siren, a line in a list -- which is
     the quietest alert in the product delivered at the exact moment the
     contract the wearer armed ("ask me every five minutes, and if I stop
     answering, something is wrong") comes true. It is now `sos`, severity 5,
     with the Good Samaritan broadcast left PENDING because nobody consented
     to it: the alert exists because the person could not answer.

  2. An SOS asks its own check-ins, every five minutes, and answering two in a
     row stands it down. Before this an SOS raised from an idle phone asked
     nothing at all and could only be left by pressing a button -- which is
     exactly what somebody being followed home cannot reach for.

  3. The alert has a position that MOVES. `alerts.live_*` is the newest fix and
     `alert_track` is the trail behind it, and both stop when the server says
     so -- including the half hour after the stand-down, which is the walk home.

End to end and against a real database, because every one of these lives in the
seam between an endpoint, a SQL predicate and the five-second sweeper. A unit
test of any one of the three would have passed while the flow was broken.

RUN THIS WITH EXACTLY ONE SWEEPER ON THE DATABASE.

Not a style note -- it invalidates the results. This project routinely has a
laptop and the deployed AWS box pointed at the same Supabase, and each runs its
own five-second sweeper. Both poll the same `checkins` table, and whichever
wins a tick decides what a silence becomes; if the two are on different builds
the same test fails differently every run. Stop one of them, or point NGB at
whichever is under test:

    $env:NGB = "https://<the deployed host>"

See docs/AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md 1.1 -- the sweeper is a singleton by design.
