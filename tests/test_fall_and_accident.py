"""F3/U3 — a detector asks the wearer, and only silence reaches the family.

    python server/nigraan_server.py      # in one terminal
    python tests/test_fall_and_accident.py

This is the "done when" for fall and accident detection on the server side, and
it is written to be read as much as run. The four promises:

  1. Opening an incident check-in tells NOBODY. Not the family, not anyone --
     the whole feature is that a fall is a question first.
  2. Answering it inside the window means the family is never told, and what is
     written down instead is a private near-miss.
  3. Letting it run out raises the incident itself -- `fall` at severity 4,
     `accident` at severity 5 -- and NOT a generic `checkin_missed`, which is
     what the sweeper did before INCIDENT_ESCALATION existed. A crash filed as
     "did not reply to a message" is the most dangerous understatement in the
     product.
  4. The alert carries the pin captured at the IMPACT, not wherever the phone
     drifted to while the window ran down.

Promise 3 deliberately takes about a minute of real time, because what it is
proving is that a deadline passes with **no phone attached to anything** -- the
scenario the whole design exists for is the one where the phone is destroyed a
second after the impact.

Requires migration 005 (`python server/migrate_pg.py`).
