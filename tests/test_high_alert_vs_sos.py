"""High Alert and SOS are two different facts, and one column held both.

    python server/nigraan_server.py      # in one terminal
    python tests/test_high_alert_vs_sos.py

`mode` was answering "which alert is live" and "is High Alert armed" at once,
and POST /alert wrote 'sos' over it. The sweeper asked its High Alert check-ins
with `WHERE mode='high_alert'`, so pressing SOS ended them -- not for the
duration of the emergency, for good -- while the phone went on drawing a
countdown to a `next_buzz_at` nothing would ever match again. Found in the
field on a row whose next buzz was eighty-seven minutes overdue.

It broke the other way too: standing High Alert down wrote mode='idle' flatly,
which quietly downgraded a live SOS and stood the heartbeat watchdog down with
it.

Every check below is one of those two directions, plus the read a wearer's
phone uses to recover a question the websocket never delivered. End to end
because the bug lived in the seam between an endpoint and a SQL predicate,
which is exactly what a unit test of either one would have missed.
