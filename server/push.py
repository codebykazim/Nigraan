    """Send Hardware Remote Push Notification via Expo Push Service API.

    Delivers notifications directly to Android system push framework even when
    the app is completely closed or killed.

    `silent=True` sends a data-only push: no title, no body, nothing shown. It
    exists for one reason, and it is the reason N3.3 works at all. Expo only
    runs the app's background notification task on a terminated app for a push
    carrying `data` and nothing else -- a push with a title is drawn by the
    system and the app is never woken. So the task that fires the lock-screen
    takeover can only be reached this way, and a severity-4-or-worse alert
    therefore goes out twice: once visibly, so something appears even if the
    silent one is dropped, and once silently, to start the siren.

    `channel`, `ttl` and `sound` override what severity would otherwise decide.
    They exist for the one push that travels the other way -- to the person in
    trouble rather than to the people being called. "Somebody answered" must not
    be filed on the DND-bypassing siren channel, and it stops being worth
    delivering long before the informational hour is up.

    On Android 8+ the channel owns the sound and `sound` here is redundant, but
    it is sent anyway: a phone whose channel was somehow created by an older
    build would otherwise fall back to "default" and make a noise next to
    somebody hiding.

    Returns a summary of what actually happened:

        {"targets": n, "tokens": n, "accepted": n, "dropped": n, "error": str|None}

    It used to return None in every case -- success, total failure, and "nobody
    has a token" were indistinguishable to every caller. For the delivery path
    that survives a killed app, in a product whose entire job is delivery, that
    was the wrong thing not to know. Nothing is obliged to read the result, but
    `accepted == 0` is logged at ERROR for anything urgent, so a night where an
    SOS reached no phone leaves a mark that can be found afterwards.
