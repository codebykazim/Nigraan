"""
One logger for the process, with a timestamp on every line.

The server used to say everything through `print()`. That is fine while
somebody is watching the terminal and useless afterwards, which is the wrong
way round for this product: the events worth reading back are the ones that
happened at 02:14 while nobody was watching. "Why did nobody get paged" is a
question about a specific minute, and an untimestamped line cannot answer it.

So every operational event goes through `get_logger(__name__)` and comes out
as

    2026-09-03 02:14:07  WARNING  nigraan.push   no registered device ...

What deliberately stays on `print()`: the startup banner in __main__.py and
migrate_pg.py's progress. Those are a person being spoken to at a terminal,
not a record of anything, and stamping a time on them only makes them harder
to read.

Set LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG in .env for more; the default is INFO.
