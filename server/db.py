"""
The connection pool, and the only two ways to get a connection out of it.

`db()` borrows one. `borrow(c)` uses the caller's if there is one. Everything
else in the server goes through those, which is what keeps the count of live
Supabase sessions bounded -- see the comment on the pool below for what
happens when it is not.

_POOL is a module-level singleton and `close_db()` reassigns it, so this module
must be imported as `server.db` from everywhere. Importing it flatly as `db`
would give the process a second pool against the same fifteen-connection cap.
