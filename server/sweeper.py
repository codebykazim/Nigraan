The 5-second tick that makes deadlines true with no phone attached.

This is the half of the server that does not wait to be asked. A check-in runs
out, High Alert comes round again, a heartbeat stops -- and the phone that
should have reported may be dead, off, taken, or killed by an OEM battery
manager, which is precisely the case the product exists for.

sweep_once is factored out so a test can drive one tick directly.
