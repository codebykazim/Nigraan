"""WHEN "SHE WENT QUIET" IS WORTH WAKING A FAMILY FOR.

`watch_lost` is the alert that says: the wearer's watch stopped reporting, and
Nigraan cannot tell you why. It is the loudest thing the product says about an
absence rather than an event, so it has exactly one job -- and getting it wrong
in either direction is expensive. Send it when nothing happened and the family
learns to ignore the one that matters. Miss it and the whole "what if her phone
is dead" answer evaporates.

THE RULE, IN ONE SENTENCE
------------------------
The family is paged only on the TRANSITION out of a state that was genuinely
worth protecting: the phone had a live link to the band, AND an alert (SOS or
High Alert) was running, AND *then* the link went away.

Three things follow from that sentence, and each of them was a bug:

  1. It is a transition, not a reading. The sweeper used to select rows whose
     columns happened to look bad at the moment it ran, which is a different
     question -- "is this state true now" rather than "did this state just
     end". A row can arrive in the bad-looking state without anything having
     happened: raising an SOS on a phone that has been idle and silent since
     lunch flips `mode` to 'sos' against a `last_beat` three hours old, and the
     next tick pages the family for a loss that never occurred. The press
     itself already told them. See `on_silence`.

  2. The state has to be the one that existed BEFORE the loss, and it has to be
     one we actually witnessed. `mode` is live and server-owned: it is mutated
     by /alert and /watch/high_alert long after the last beat, so reading it at
     sweep time answers "is she armed now", not "was she armed when she went
     quiet". So the beat writes down what was true at the beat -- `beat_armed`,
     `beat_band_link` -- and the loss is judged against that.

  3. A link that never existed cannot be lost. `band_link` was in the row the
     whole time and the watchdog never looked at it, so an armed phone with no
     band anywhere near it reported its wearer's watch lost.

THE RACE, AND WHICH SIDE OF IT WINS
-----------------------------------
An alert can be armed or stood down in the same second the band drops, and the
two facts reach the server by different roads (an HTTP call, versus the absence
of one). The rule here is deliberate and one-directional:

    THE STATE IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE DISCONNECT WINS.

An alert armed at 12:00:30 against a band that dropped at 12:00:31 counts --
the alert was running while the link was still up, which is exactly the state
the rule protects. An alert armed *after* the link was already gone does not,
however close behind it came. And an alert stood down before the drop does not
resurrect it.

That asymmetry is chosen rather than incidental. Being wrong in the quiet
direction costs the family nothing here, because the thing racing us is itself
an alert: an SOS raised at the moment of the drop pages everyone at severity 5
on its own. A duplicate `watch_lost` alongside it adds noise to the worst
minute of somebody's day and no information at all.

A PHONE STANDING IN FOR A BAND IS NOT A BAND
--------------------------------------------
In virtual mode the phone runs the band's firmware itself, and it reports
`band_link=true` -- correctly, because the gestures work. But there is no
wristband, and this alert is specifically about one going away. So the link
that counts here is the PHYSICAL one:

    beat_band_link = band_link AND NOT virtual

Deliberately narrow, and it costs something worth naming: a virtual-mode wearer
whose phone dies mid-SOS gets no `watch_lost`. That is the right trade anyway,
because in virtual mode the phone IS the band -- there is no second device to
report the loss of, and the family already has the SOS. What the old rule did
instead was tell them a wristband had stopped answering when no wristband had
ever existed, which sends people looking for a device that was never in play.

And the exclusion runs in BOTH directions: virtual mode is INERT here, not
merely disqualifying. A beat that reports virtual mode never pages, including
the beat that switches a real band over to it. That switch does end a physical
link, and an earlier draft of this rule treated it as the disconnect for
exactly that reason -- but it is a setting being changed on a screen, by a
person holding the phone, and paging a family about it is a false alarm with a
plausible-sounding justification behind it. `watch_lost` means a wristband
stopped answering. Nothing about virtual mode may raise it.

What still pages is a real band dropping while the app is in BLE mode -- which
is the whole feature, and is not affected by any of this, because the mode is a
stored user preference and a band going out of range does not change it.

THE GRACE WINDOW
----------------
A drop does not page anybody the moment it is seen. It starts a clock --
`WATCH_LOST_DELAY_S`, two minutes -- and the page goes out only if the band is
still gone when that clock runs out. A band that comes back inside the window
cancels the whole thing silently.

This is a debounce on the physical world, not on the code. Bluetooth drops for
reasons that are not emergencies: a wrist inside a coat sleeve, a phone in the
other pocket, a microwave, Android throttling the radio while the screen is
off. Every one of those looks identical to a torn-off band for the first few
seconds, and only one of them is worth waking a family for. Two minutes is long
enough for the link to come back on its own and short enough that a real loss
is still fresh news.

Two consequences worth knowing:

  - The countdown is held in the database (`link_lost_at`), not in a task or a
    timer. A timer belongs to a process, and this server restarting must not
    quietly cancel a countdown somebody's safety depends on.
  - The clock is watched by the sweeper, which ticks every five seconds, so the
    page lands within a few seconds of the two-minute mark rather than whenever
    the next heartbeat happens to arrive.

The countdown is about the LINK, not the alert. If High Alert escalates to SOS
while the band is away, the clock keeps running and one page goes out at the
two-minute mark -- an escalation is not a new disconnect and must not restart
the wait. The single exception is a stand-down, which cancels: see
`on_grace_elapsed`.

FLAPPING
--------
A band at the edge of range drops and re-links every few seconds. Most of that
is now absorbed by the grace window above -- a bounce never reaches the point
of paging at all. `REARM_S` is the second, coarser guard, and it covers what
the window cannot: a band that is gone for a full two minutes, comes back, and
goes again. After a page the alert is held down for `REARM_S` regardless of
what the link does in between. Arming a new episode clears it; a bounce inside
one episode does not.

Everything in this module is pure: no database, no clock, no network. The
server passes the row in and applies what comes back, and the whole rule can be
tested in milliseconds without a Postgres anywhere -- see
tests/test_watch_lost_transition.py.
