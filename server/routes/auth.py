# ---- the band PIN, held against the account ----------------------------
#
# Escrow for a six-digit wristband PIN, so a wearer who has forgotten it is not
# reduced to a factory reset -- which also wipes the band's name and forces
# every phone in the family to pair again.
#
# It exists because of a rule elsewhere that is correct and stays: pressing
# Disconnect makes the phone forget the PIN. That is what makes Disconnect a
# real answer to "somebody else has my phone", and it is also precisely what
# removes the local copy in the one situation somebody needs it back.
#
# READ server/migrations/009_band_pin_escrow.sql BEFORE TRUSTING THIS. The
# column is plaintext and has to be -- the entire purpose is to hand it back to
# a person, so it cannot be hashed. Anybody who can read the table, or sign in
# as the user, gets the PIN. This is an accepted interim position with the
# trade understood, not a finished design; the migration lists what replaces it.
#
# Three rules hold here regardless:
#
#   1. `band_pin` is never added to /me or /login. It leaves the server through
#      exactly one endpoint, the one below whose whole job is to return it.
#   2. Reads are rate limited per account. A stolen session should not be able
#      to walk anything, and this is the only endpoint that hands back a secret
#      it did not receive in the request.
#   3. It is never logged.
