"""
Every HTTP and websocket endpoint, grouped the way the API reads.

ROUTERS is ordered, and the order is load-bearing: FastAPI matches paths in
the order they were registered, so /checkin/self has to be mounted before
/checkin/{member_id} or the literal path is swallowed by the parameter. Within
a file that ordering is the order the routes are written in; across files it is
this list. It is the declaration order the single-file server had.
