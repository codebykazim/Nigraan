    `acked_at`, so the row goes on being open indefinitely. Ordered by `due_at`
    alone, that dead row is always the oldest, so it masks every live question
    behind it: a wearer with an unanswered fall gets the SOS's own five-minute
    knock rendered as the fall from twenty minutes ago, and the family screen
    counts down to a deadline that expired before they even opened the app.

    Still returned when nothing live is waiting, which is the point of putting
    it second rather than excluding it. Answering late is a real thing people
    do, and it still means what it always meant.
