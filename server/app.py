The application factory: middleware, lifespan, and the routers mounted on it.

`app` is built at import time as well, so `uvicorn server.app:app` works.

This is the only module allowed to know that all the others exist. Nothing
imports it -- see the layering note in server/__init__.py -- which is what
keeps the import graph acyclic now that there are twenty-odd modules in it.
