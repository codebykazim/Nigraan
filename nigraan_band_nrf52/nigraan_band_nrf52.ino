   NIGRAAN BAND — XIAO nRF52840 SENSE FIRMWARE
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The band. This is the only firmware in the tree -- the ESP32 prototype it was
   ported from was retired on 27 Aug 2026. It speaks the EXACT protocol that
   prototype spoke, and the one `virtualBand.js` speaks on the phone, so the app
   cannot tell which of them answered. That is the whole point of this file:
   EXECUTION_PLAN.md section 5 is frozen.

   Transport : BLE, Nordic UART Service — newline-delimited JSON, via BLEUart
   Board     : Seeed XIAO nRF52840 **Sense**  (Seeeduino:nrf52:xiaonRF52840Sense)
   Core      : Seeed nRF52 Boards 1.1.13 (Adafruit Bluefruit) — NOT the mbed one
   Library   : Seeed Arduino LSM6DS3 (only needed once HAS_IMU flips to 1)

   Wiring — proven on the bench by T2/T3, see firmware/README.md:
     BTN    -> D2  -> other leg to GND    (INPUT_PULLUP, no resistor)
     MOTOR  -> D1  -> driver module IN    (100 uF bulk cap across motor supply)
     LED    -> onboard, pin 11, ACTIVE LOW

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   WHAT CAME OVER VERBATIM (F2.1)

   `Pattern` / `feedback()` / `feedbackTick()`, `Button` / `buttonTick()`,
   `onGesture()`, `jsonStr()` / `jsonInt()` / `handleCommand()` came over
   unchanged from the ESP32 prototype. They were already correct and already
   agreed with the app; re-deriving them would only introduce drift.
   The prototype is gone from the tree; `git show 70c5176:nigraan_band_esp32/
   nigraan_band_esp32.ino` is the record if the provenance is ever in question.

   WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY

     BLE layer      BLEDevice/BLEServer/BLE2902 -> BLEUart. Bluefruit ships NUS
                    as one object, so the three-characteristic dance is gone.
     Button B       Deleted. The shipped band has one button, and the gesture
                    map already put everything on button 1 -- so this removes
                    a line, not a feature.
     IMU            MPU6050 path deleted (F2.2). The Sense has an LSM6DS3TR-C
                    on board at 0x6A; external-IMU code is work spent on
                    hardware we do not have.
     Battery        SIM_BATTERY replaced with the real divider (F2.3).
     LED polarity   Active LOW on this board. See ledWrite().

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   OPEN — THE HAPTIC TIMINGS BELOW ARE CORRECT AND CURRENTLY IMPERCEPTIBLE

   Every feedback() pulse width here (60-250 ms) is the RIGHT value for a
   healthy coin ERM, which reaches speed in 50-80 ms. On the current motor
   module ~300 ms is the floor, so as of today most of these cannot be felt.

   DO NOT "fix" this by raising the numbers. At a 300 ms floor a 1-pulse ack and
   a 4-pulse SOS both degrade into "a long buzz happened", and SOS confirmation
   slips from 0.7 s to 1.8 s -- in the one moment the wearer cannot wait and
   cannot look. The driver is what is broken. firmware/README.md carries the
   diagnosis and the 20-second test that settles it.

   These numbers become correct the moment the driver is fixed. Leave them.

//
// It is NOT the same question as DEFAULT_PAIR_PIN, and conflating the two is a

// comparing against DEFAULT_PAIR_PIN would reward them with a permanent amber
// banner telling them to do the thing they already did.

// value gets nagged.
#define PUBLISHED_PIN    "123456"

// ------------------------------------------------------------ THE GATE ---
//
// Two locks, because they fail in different directions and this band is worth
// locking twice.
//
//   BLE pairing (passkey)   The SoftDevice will not let anybody subscribe to a
//                           notification or write a command until the link is
//                           encrypted with MITM protection, and getting there
//                           means typing six digits into Android's own pairing
//                           dialog. This is real cryptography and it protects
//                           everything on the wire.
//
//   The auth handshake      Encryption proves the phone paired ONCE. It does
//                           not prove the phone should still be here: a bond
//                           outlives an uninstall, a resale, a stolen handset.
//                           So the band also stays mute until the app sends
//                           {"c":"auth","pin":"..."} over that encrypted link,
//                           and changing the PIN then locks out every phone
//                           still holding a bond, without anybody having to go
//                           near Android's Bluetooth settings.
//
// Until a connection clears BOTH, the band sends no events, obeys no commands,
// keeps its SOS beacon flying, and does not tell the wearer it is linked.
// Two windows, because two very different things are being waited on.
//
// LINK_SETTLE_MS covers pairing: a person reading six digits off a screen and
// typing them into Android's dialog, which is slow and must not be rushed. It
// is here so an idle unauthenticated connection cannot sit on the band's only
// connection slot forever, keeping it off the air and unreachable by the phone
// that actually owns it.
//
// AUTH_WINDOW_MS starts later and is much tighter: it begins when the phone
// subscribes to notifications, by which point pairing is already done and the
// handshake is one automatic round trip. Whichever deadline is sooner wins.
#define LINK_SETTLE_MS  60000   // connect -> authenticated, generous
#define AUTH_WINDOW_MS  8000    // subscribed -> authenticated, strict
#define AUTH_MAX_TRIES  3       // wrong PIN this many times and the link goes

// ---- and the limit that actually costs an attacker something --------------
//
// AUTH_MAX_TRIES above only ends a CONNECTION. On its own it is close to
// worthless: reconnecting is free and unlimited, so three guesses per link is
// really unlimited guesses, and a six-digit PIN falls to a patient script.
//
// So failures are also counted ACROSS connections, and past a threshold the
// band stops answering at all for a while. The delay doubles-ish each time and
// caps, which turns 10^6 guesses from an afternoon into geological time while
// costing an owner who fat-fingers their PIN twice absolutely nothing.
//
// Five free attempts before any of it starts. That is deliberately generous:
// the person most likely to get this wrong is the owner, typing from memory,
// and the first thing a lockout must not do is punish them.
//
// DELIBERATELY NOT PERSISTED. The counter lives in RAM, so a power cycle
// clears it -- and that is not the hole it looks like. Power-cycling this band
// means holding it, and anybody holding it can hold the button through boot and
// factory-reset the PIN outright. A flash write per wrong guess would buy
// nothing against an attacker who already has the better option, and would
// spend the flash's erase budget on it.
//
// SAFETY NOTE, because this is a safety device: while locked out the band
// cannot link to a phone, so a press cannot reach the family over BLE. That is
// the price of having a lock at all, and it is bounded three ways -- five free
// tries, a fifteen-minute ceiling, and the button-through-boot reset, which
// works during a lockout like any other time.

// ------------------------------------------------- PRESS & OUTCOME FEEDBACK ---
//
// Two facts, told separately, by whichever side actually knows them. The whole
// reasoning is in docs/BAND_FEEDBACK_SPEC.md; the short version:
//
//   "I heard you"   -- the band knows this instantly. One TICK per press, so
//                      two taps are felt as two ticks and the wearer can tell
//                      "not registered" (press again) from "registered and
//                      failed" (stop pressing, find your phone). Those need
//                      opposite responses and used to feel identical.
//
//   "It went / it didn't" -- the band CANNOT know this. A successful UART write
//                      means the phone received the press, not that the family
//                      was paged; with the app's offline queue an SOS can sit
//                      unsent for minutes. So the band asks and waits, and the
//                      phone answers with {c:'ack'}, {c:'queued'} or
//                      {c:'failed'}.
//
// The one case the band CAN answer alone is having no link at all: nothing can
// have received it, so FAILED goes out immediately with no waiting.
//
// 90 ms is the floor everywhere here. It is the shortest width confirmed felt on
// this hardware, and it is what the check-in ack already used.
// ---- the check-in nag ------------------------------------------------------
//
// A check-in used to buzz ONCE at the top of its window and then say nothing
// until the window expired -- at which point it buzzed again, but that second
// buzz was not a reminder, it was the news that the family had already been
// told the wearer did not answer.
//
// One buzz is trivially missed: asleep, in the shower, band under a sleeve, in
// a noisy street. And the cost of missing it is not a missed notification, it
// is a false alarm sent to everybody who cares about this person. So the
// question is now asked repeatedly until it is answered or the window closes.
//
// The nag is the check-in pattern with one pulse taken off, not a new pattern.
// It is the SAME question being asked again, and 400 ms pulses are used by
// nothing else, so it cannot be mistaken for anything -- and the vocabulary
// does not grow.
//
// It tightens near the deadline. That is the only way a wrist can say "you are
// running out of time" to somebody who is not looking at a screen.
//
// Costs roughly 0.02 mAh per nag. In High Alert -- the one mode that asks
// unprompted, every 5-10 minutes -- budget a few percent of the cell per day.
// That is the price of the mode, and it is cheaper than a false escalation.
#define CHECKIN_NAG_MS        12000   // ordinary reminder interval
#define CHECKIN_NAG_URGENT_MS  5000   // once the deadline is close
#define CHECKIN_URGENT_AT_MS  20000   // "close" = this much of the window left

// ---- what an outcome feels like, by what was being confirmed ---------------
//
// An SOS getting through and an "I'm fine" getting through are not the same
// news and must not feel the same. The SOS one is a single firm buzz, longer
// than anything the check-in path produces, because it is the one confirmation
// a frightened person is waiting for and it has to be unmistakable without
// counting anything.
//
// FAILED is two long heavy buzzes rather than one. A single buzz now means
// "sent", so failure cannot also be a single buzz -- distinguishing 400 ms from
// 900 ms on a wrist under stress is not a distinction anybody should have to
// make, and it is the most dangerous pair in the whole vocabulary to confuse.
// Repetition is the safer signal: one buzz is a full stop, two heavy ones are
// insistent, and insistent is what "this did not go" should feel like.

// The LED's two standing states. Flashes, never steady: a 2 mA LED held on
// against a 250-400 mAh cell is 5-8 days on its own, against a 1-2 week budget.
// 20 ms every 3-5 s is a ~0.5% duty cycle and costs essentially nothing.
#define LINK_LED_FLASH_MS       20
#define LINK_LED_PERIOD_UP_MS   5000    // linked: one brief flash, unobtrusive
#define LINK_LED_PERIOD_DOWN_MS 2000    // not linked: a double flash, more often
#define LINK_LED_GAP_MS         180     // spacing of the double flash

// ------------------------------------------------------- THE SOS BEACON ---
//
// The way an SOS gets out when there is no link to get it out on.
//
// A GATT connection is opened by the phone, never by the band, and it only
// exists while the phone's app is alive to hold it. On most non-Samsung
// Android skins -- Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi, Huawei, Transsion -- swiping the app off
// the Recents screen runs `kill -9` on it, which no foreground service and no
// permission can survive. The wearer walks out with a band that looks linked,
// is not, and will drop their SOS on the floor.
//
// So the press also goes out in the advertisement itself, where no connection
// is required. Android 8+ lets an app hand the OS a scan filter plus a
// PendingIntent; the Bluetooth chip watches for the pattern and the *system*
// starts the app when it appears -- with the app killed, hours later. That is
// what these bytes are for. `modules/nigraan-bandwake` is the other half.
//
// Layout, 6 bytes inside the manufacturer-specific field:
//
//     FF FF   'N' 'G'   flag   seq
//     \___/   \_____/   \__/   \_/
//       |        |       |      +-- press counter, wraps; the phone dedups on it
//       |        |       +--------- 0 idle, 1 SOS standing
//       |        +----------------- our magic, because company FFFF is the
//       |                           testing id and half the world uses it
//       +-------------------------- company id, little-endian, SIG "testing"
//
// The phone filters on `FF FF 'N' 'G' 01` with a full mask, so an idle band
// never wakes it and the sequence byte is free to change. Filtering in the
// chip rather than in software is also what makes this legal at all: since
// Android 8.1 a background scan with no filter returns nothing while the
// screen is off, which is exactly when this has to work.
#define SOS_BEACON_COMPANY_LO  0xFF

#define SOS_BEACON_MAGIC_0     'N'
#define SOS_BEACON_MAGIC_1     'G'

// unpaired in a drawer is not still crying SOS tomorrow.
#define SOS_BEACON_MS          600000UL   // 10 minutes

// ------------------------------------------------- FALL AND IMPACT (F3) ---
//
// TWO DETECTORS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM DECIDES ANYTHING.
//
// A fall has a shape the band can recognise on its own: the wrist goes light
// (free-fall), then it is hit, then it stops moving. All three parts are
// visible from the accelerometer alone, so the band is entitled to call it and
// say `fall`.
//
// A crash does not have that shape. There is no free-fall -- a rider hits a car
// at 40 km/h with 1 g of gravity on the wrist the whole way -- and what is left
// is a spike, which on a WRIST is also a clap, a door slammed, a hand put down
// hard on a table, a cricket bat. The band cannot tell those apart and must not
// pretend to. So it reports the measurement and nothing more: `impact`, with
// the peak, the rotation and whether the arm went still afterwards.
//
// What turns that into an accident is the ONE fact the band does not have and
// the phone does: how fast this person was travelling ten seconds ago. An 11 g
// spike at walking pace is furniture. The same spike at 45 km/h is a crash.
// src/motion.js owns that judgement; see docs/FALL_AND_ACCIDENT.md.
//
// This split is the same one the press feedback already uses: each side says
// only what it actually knows.

// 100 Hz. Free-fall from standing lasts 300-500 ms and the minimum below is
// 70 ms, so this samples the shortest thing we care about seven times.
//
// It is NOT enough to catch a true impact peak: the spike itself is 5-15 ms
// wide, so `peak_g` here is a LOWER BOUND on what the wrist actually felt.
// That is fine for a threshold and wrong for a physics claim -- if a reading
// ever has to be exact, it needs the LSM6DS3's own FIFO at 416 Hz, not a
// faster loop(). Every threshold below is calibrated at THIS rate; changing it
// changes what they mean.
#define IMU_PERIOD_MS         10

// ---- a fall, by either of two routes ---------------------------------------
//
// PEOPLE DO NOT FREE-FALL. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT COMMENT IN THIS FILE.
//
// The three-stage machine below -- light, then hit, then still -- is the
// textbook fall detector, and taken alone it misses the falls this product
// exists for. A person does not drop; they TOPPLE. Rotating about the feet or
// the hips takes 0.7-1.2 s, and the wrist stays attached to a body the whole
// way, so it frequently never reads below 0.45 g for 70 ms at all.
//
// The falls that do produce clean free-fall are faints. Trips, slips, a leg
// giving way, and the slow slump an elderly person actually has produce little
// or none -- and those are the majority. Making free-fall a mandatory gate
// therefore fails silently on the common case, which is the wrong direction to
// be wrong in for a safety device.
//
// So free-fall is EVIDENCE, not a requirement. It is one of two routes in:
//
//   ROUTE A -- "it dropped".  free-fall -> impact -> still.
//              The impact bar is low (2.40 g) because the free-fall already
//              corroborated that something fell. This is the classic path and
//              it catches faints and falls from a height.
//
//   ROUTE B -- "it was hit".  a HARDER impact -> the wearer ended up at a
//              different angle -> still, for longer.
//              No free-fall required. This is the topple, and it is carried by
//              the two things a topple genuinely does produce: a solid landing,
//              and a body that is now oriented differently from how it was.
//
// Route B needs its own evidence because "a spike then stillness" on its own is
// also a hand put down hard on a desk. The orientation change is what separates
// them: clapping, slamming a door and setting a hand down all leave the wearer
// in the same posture they started in, and going to the floor does not.

// thing ctags calls a function -- which, since SecureUart::begin() appeared
// below, may be the class rather than ledWrite(). buttonTick()'s generated
// prototype takes a `Button&`, so if the injection point moves above the
// declaration the sketch stops compiling for a reason that has nothing to do
// with anything anybody edited. Declaring it before the class as well costs one

// further down is kept deliberately; a repeat is legal and it is where somebody
// reading the button engine will look for it.

// -------------------------------------------------- THE ENCRYPTED UART ---
//
// Stock BLEUart leaves both characteristics wide open -- its own source carries

// -------------------------------------------------------- GESTURE MAP ---
// This is the ONLY place hardware meets meaning, and it must stay identical to
// DEFAULT_GESTURES in nigraan-app/src/virtualBand.js -- the two implementations
// of this map that remain.
//
// Follows EXECUTION_PLAN.md section 5, the frozen contract:
//
//     1 tap        checkin_ack        "I'm fine" / stands down a live SOS
//     2+ taps      sos                double-tap is the specified gesture
//     hold 3 s     high_alert_on/off  toggles High Alert
//
// Nothing is bound to hold 5 s. Anti-snatch is deferred to v2, so the wearer
// has two things to remember rather than three.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE SLOW-TAP FAILURE — why SOS fires early and checkin_ack fires late
//
// The original design counted taps, waited CLICK_GAP_MS (420 ms) for the burst
// to end, and only then decided what had happened. That has a failure mode
// worse than not working at all:
//
//   Someone frightened taps twice, but slowly -- 500 ms apart. Each tap closes
//   its own burst. The band sends checkin_ack. Twice. The family is told
//   "I'm fine" by a person calling for help.
//
// The two errors are not equally bad. A false SOS is embarrassing and someone
// stands it down in seconds. A false "I'm fine" is silent, final, and arrives
// exactly when it must not. So the tie is broken toward SOS, always:
//
//   * SOS fires on the SECOND TAP ITSELF, not when the burst closes. Nothing is
//     waited for, and the ack can no longer win the race by going first. This
//     also makes a real SOS ~400 ms faster, which is the case that needs it.
//
//   * checkin_ack waits TAP_WINDOW_MS (1200 ms) before committing, because it
//     is the claim we must never make by accident. Two taps up to 1.2 s apart
//     are now SOS. The cost is that "I'm fine" confirms a beat later, and
//     nobody is in danger while that beat passes.
//
// A consequence worth accepting rather than fixing: a wearer who taps, feels
// no buzz, and taps again out of doubt now raises an SOS. That is the correct
// direction to fail, and it is the same reasoning that already makes 3, 4 and
// 5 taps SOS. It will also get rarer once the haptics are strong enough to
// confirm the first tap -- see the driver note at the top of this file.
//
// virtualBand.js must match this. It still has the old 420 ms burst logic and
// therefore still has the bug.
