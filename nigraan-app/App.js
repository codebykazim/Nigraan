  //
  // Turned off on purpose on 1 Sep 2026. The full reasoning, and the exact
  // steps to turn it back on, are in docs/BAND_WAKE_DISABLED.md. Nothing was
  // deleted: the three effects that drove it are kept verbatim below this one,
  // commented out, and the module they call is switched off at
  // `BAND_WAKE_ENABLED` in src/bandWake.js and `BandWake.FEATURE_ENABLED` in
  // BandWake.kt.
  //
  // The short version: the wake carries no band identity, so one band's press
  // is accepted by every Nigraan phone in range (BUG-012) and swallows the
  // second wearer's own SOS on the way past (BUG-013). Both are Critical, both
  // need a band id in the advertisement, and that means new firmware in the
  // field before this can be trusted again. On the reporter's Android 8 Vivo
  // the wake also drags unrelated apps to the foreground (BUG-018).
  //
  // What is given up by switching it off, said plainly: on an OEM skin that
  // runs `kill -9` on a Recents swipe, a press with the app killed now reaches
  // nobody. The band is only a working safety device while this app or its
  // foreground service is alive.
  //
  // This effect is the one live remnant, and it is a cleanup rather than a
  // feature: a phone updating from a build that had the wake armed still has a
  // registration in the Bluetooth stack and an `armed` flag in the module's
  // storage that BandWakeBootReceiver would act on after the next reboot.
  // `stopBandWake()` clears both. It is cheap, idempotent and a no-op on a
  // phone that never had it.
  useEffect(() => { stopBandWake(); }, []);

  /* ---- SWITCHED OFF: the beacon path, kept for whoever turns it back on ----

  // The foreground service above is the app's attempt to stay alive. On most
  // non-Samsung skins it loses: a swipe on the Recents screen is `kill -9`, and
  // the GATT link dies with the process. From that moment the band looks linked
  // and can reach nobody, which is the exact state a wearer walks out in.
  //
  // So the SOS also goes out in the band's advertisement, and the scan that
  // matches it is registered with Android rather than held by us -- it outlives
  // the kill. See src/bandWake.js.
  //
  // Armed on the same standing instruction the link itself runs on, and
  // deliberately NOT on `session`: a signed-out phone still wants the press
  // written down, and the pending record waits for a session rather than being

  // ---- offline queue: every chance to flush it ----------------------------
  //
  // The rising edge of the WebSocket was the only trigger, and it is the one
  // that cannot fire when it matters most: the socket lives in this tree, so a
  // phone whose app is off screen when signal returns reconnects nothing and
  // delivers nothing until somebody opens it. Four triggers now, because each
  // covers a case the others cannot:
  //
  //   1. the socket's rising edge   -- app open, signal returns
  //   2. coming back to the app     -- reopened after being backgrounded
  //   3. a timer while anything is queued -- app open but the socket is not
  //      the thing that came back (captive portal, server restarted)
  //   4. the foreground service's tick -- app closed entirely; see bgService
  //
  // Two of these firing together would send the same alert twice, and a family
  // paged twice for one press is how a real one gets ignored. There are two
  // guards against that now, at different depths: `flushing` below keeps this
  // screen from doing redundant work, the queue's own interlock covers the
  // background service that this ref cannot see, and `client_id` makes a
  // duplicate that gets through harmless at the server. The last one is the
  // only one that survives the app being killed mid-send.

  // when there are none, which on Android is most of the time: backgrounded,
  // killed by the OEM, or on a train.
  //
  // The check-in row exists either way and its deadline is real. Ninety
  // seconds later the sweeper escalates it and the family is told she did not

  // as well, but a push is not a guarantee either.

  // memory-only, so a restart forgets High Alert, `watchMode` falls back to
