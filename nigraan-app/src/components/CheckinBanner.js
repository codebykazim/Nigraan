/**
 * U3.1 — the open question, and how long is left to answer it.
 *
 * The countdown runs to `due_at`, which is the server's deadline in the
 * server's clock, sent with the request. It is not a local ninety-second timer
 * that happens to agree: the sweeper escalates on its own row in the database,
 * so a phone that woke up late has to show what is actually left, not what
 * would be left if the message had arrived on time.
 *
 * Shown after the ask-sheet is dismissed, so "later" never means "forgotten".
 *
 * THREE QUESTIONS, NOT ONE. A person asking is one thing; High Alert's standing
 * five-minute question is another; and the question an SOS asks is a third, and
 * it is the opposite of the other two. Those two are answered to STAY clear.
 * The SOS one is answered to GET clear -- two in a row and the alert stands
 * itself down -- and a wearer under pressure should not have to work that out,
 * or keep count. `streak` is the server's count and it is put on the screen.
