 * notification and the ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION prompt for nothing, since
 * their emergencies arrive by push and push works with the app dead.
 *
 * "Does this phone want a band" is also the wrong question, and more
 * dangerously so: an armed phone in virtual mode has no band at all, and its
 * heartbeat is the only thing standing between it and the server telling the
 * whole family its wearer has gone silent. App.js owns that decision; see the
 * effect there for both conditions.
 *
 * `shouldRun` is deliberately a strict tri-state rather than anything truthy:
 *
 *   true  -- this phone is holding a link or is armed; service up
 *   false -- neither; service down
 *   null  -- could not tell (see band.js wantsBand); change nothing
 *
 * The null case is the one that matters. Treating "don't know" as false would
 * stop the service, kill the process and drop a live BLE link on nothing worse
 * than a transient AsyncStorage error. Leaving a service up one cycle too long
 * costs a notification; taking it down wrongly costs the emergency path, so
 * this fails in the first direction on purpose.
 *
 * Idempotent: both start and stop already check the current state, so calling
 * this on every render pass or status change is free.
