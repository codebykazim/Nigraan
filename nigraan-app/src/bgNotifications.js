/**
 * The killed-app half of N3.3.
 *
 * `presentAlarm` needs JavaScript to be running, and the case the whole feature
 * exists for -- the family's phone locked on a bedside table, the app killed by
 * Android hours ago -- is exactly the case where it is not. A data-only push is
 * the one thing that starts it: Android hands the message to the app, Expo
 * spins up a headless JS runtime, this task runs, and it fires the full-screen
 * intent from there.
 *
 * Two constraints came out of the SDK 57 docs and shape everything below:
 *
 *   - Only a push carrying `data` and *no* `title`/`body` reaches this task
 *     when the app is terminated. A normal push with a title is shown by the
 *     system and the task is not run. That is why the server sends **two**
 *     pushes for a severity-4-or-worse alert (`nigraan_server.py`): a visible
 *     one, which guarantees something appears even if this path fails, and a
 *     silent one, which is what actually wakes the siren.
 *
 *   - "The OS may decide not to deliver the notification to your app in some
 *     cases", Doze being the usual one. So this is an upgrade to the push path,
 *     never a replacement for it. If it does not run, the visible notification
 *     is still sitting there to be tapped, and the tap routing added on
 *     26 Aug 2026 still opens the right alert.
 *
 * `defineTask` runs at module load, not inside `registerBackgroundNotifications`
 * -- same reason as `bgService.js`: when Android relaunches the runtime
 * headlessly, the task has to already be defined or the wake is wasted.

 * from a headless task stops when Android tears that task down a few seconds
 * later. Without the call below, the killed-app path could end in nothing at
 * all, which is the one outcome the whole feature exists to prevent.
 *
 * It moved because guarding only this task was half a fix: the websocket path
 * in App.js posted with no such check, so one alert arrived two and three times
 * over whenever the app was open. One helper, used by both.
