/**
 * ONE BAND, TWO RADIOS.
 *
 * The app should not care whether the wristband is a real nRF52840 across a
 * BLE link or the phone itself running `virtualBand.js`. This hook is the seam
 * that makes that true: it owns both, exposes exactly the shape `useBand`
 * already returned, and normalises their event lines through the same path.
 *
 * So App.js and Home.js keep working unchanged, and the day the hardware turns
 * up the only thing that happens is a toggle moving from VIRTUAL to BAND.
