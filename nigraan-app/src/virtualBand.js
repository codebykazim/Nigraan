/**
 * VIRTUAL BAND — the phone pretending to be the wristband.
 *
 * This is not a set of debug buttons. It is a JavaScript port of the band
 * firmware, `nigraan_band_nrf52/nigraan_band_nrf52.ino`: the same button
 * engine, the same gesture map, the same event JSON, the same command handler.
 * (The port was originally taken from the ESP32 prototype, retired 27 Aug 2026;
 * the two sketches shared this logic verbatim.) The rest of
 * the app cannot tell the difference between this and a real band over BLE,
 * because it receives byte-identical lines either way.
 *
 * Why bother, when `useBand().simulate()` already exists? Because `simulate()`
 * fires a *conclusion* ("sos"). It skips the part that is actually hard and
 * actually untested: turning presses and accelerometer samples into gestures.
 * That logic has to be right on the band; writing it here means it is debugged
 * somewhere with a screen and a console, and the constants it is tuned with
 * port straight across when the nRF52840 arrives.
 *
 * What is genuinely simulated: the radio. Everything above it is real.

// PEOPLE DO NOT FREE-FALL. A person does not drop, they TOPPLE -- rotating

// whole way, so it often never reads below 0.45 g for 70 ms at all. The falls
// that DO free-fall are faints; trips, slips and the slow slump an elderly
// person actually has produce little or none, and those are the majority.
//
// So free-fall is evidence, not a requirement, and there are two routes in:
//
//   A "it dropped"  free-fall -> impact (low bar, 2.4 g) -> still.
//   B "it was hit"  a harder impact (4 g) -> the wearer ended up at a
//                   different angle -> still, for longer. No free-fall.
//
// Route B needs the angle because "a spike then stillness" is also a hand put
// down hard on a desk -- and a clap, a slammed door and a palm on a table all
// leave the wearer in the posture they started in. Going to the floor does not.
//
// Identical to the same block in nigraan_band_nrf52.ino. Two implementations
// of one decision, exactly like the gesture map, and they drift the same way:
// in silence, until a demo behaves differently on the phone and on the wrist.

// is a spike, and a spike on its own is also a phone dropped on a table, a door
// slammed with it in a pocket, or a cricket bat.
//
// So this half deliberately concludes nothing. It reports how hard, how much
// rotation and how still things went afterwards, and `motion.js` decides what

// was travelling. Mirrors the IMPACT block in the .ino, and drifts the same way
