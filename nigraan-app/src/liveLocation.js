/**
 * Where she is now, for as long as that is the question.
 *
 * An alert used to carry exactly one position: the fix baked in at the moment
 * the button went down. For a fall in a kitchen that is the whole answer. For
 * a snatch, an abduction, or a walk home that turned bad it is the answer for
 * about thirty seconds, and after that it is a pin over a place nobody is any
 * more -- while four family members drive to it.
 *
 * WHAT "LIVE" ACTUALLY IS. Nothing on a phone streams position continuously.
 * Every live location in the world -- WhatsApp's, Google's -- is a ping on a
 * short interval, and the only real question is what the interval costs. So
 * this is a ping, at ten seconds while the emergency is new and thirty
 * afterwards, and none of it runs unless an alert is live. The cost is bounded
 * by the emergency rather than by the day.
 *
 * WHY IT RIDES THE FOREGROUND SERVICE. The obvious implementation is a
 * setInterval and `getCurrentPositionAsync`, and it works perfectly in every
 * situation this feature does not exist for. The situations it does exist for
 * all end with the app off screen: in a pocket, backgrounded, swiped out of
 * Recents, or killed outright by an OEM battery manager -- and a JS timer is
 * gone in every one of them. bgService.js already runs an Android foreground
 * service that Android keeps alive precisely so this cannot happen, and it has
 * been throwing its location payload away since the day it was written. This
 * is that payload finally being used: the ticks arrive whether or not anybody
 * is looking at the screen, and they arrive on a process Android has been told
 * not to kill.
 *
 * THE PHONE IS STILL NOT A TIMEKEEPER. The plan below -- how fast, and until
 * when -- is the SERVER's, handed back with the alert and restated in the
 * answer to every single fix. The phone caches it to disk so a headless
 * restart knows what it was doing, and it re-learns it six times a minute. A
 * tracker whose stop condition lives only in the app is a tracker that runs
 * for ever the one time the frame telling it to stop goes missing.
