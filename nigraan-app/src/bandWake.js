/**
 * THE BAND'S OWN WAY IN — SWITCHED OFF. See docs/BAND_WAKE_DISABLED.md.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TURNED OFF ON PURPOSE, 1 Sep 2026. Nothing here is deleted; the whole feature
 * hangs off `BAND_WAKE_ENABLED` below, and flipping it back to `true` (together
 * with `BandWake.FEATURE_ENABLED` on the Kotlin side and the commented-out
 * effects in App.js) restores it exactly as it was.
 *
 * Why: it wakes a phone whose app is not running, and on the reporter's Android
 * 8 Vivo it wakes other apps with it (BUG-018). Worse, the wake carries no band
 * identity, so one band's press is accepted by *every* Nigraan phone in range
 * — an emergency raised on a stranger's account, to a stranger's family, with a
 * stranger's location (BUG-012), and that same press then silently swallows the
 * second wearer's own SOS (BUG-013). Those two are Critical and they need a
 * band id in the advertisement, which means new firmware in the field before
 * the path can be trusted again.
 *
 * The trade being accepted: on an OEM that runs `kill -9` on a Recents swipe,
 * a press with the app killed now reaches nobody. That is the pre-existing
 * behaviour this feature was written to fix, and it is the deliberate choice —
 * a press that goes nowhere is better than a press that pages the wrong family
 * and eats the right one. The band must be treated as working only while the
 * app or its foreground service is alive.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * What it did, kept for whoever turns it back on: every other path an SOS can
 * take needs this app to be alive. The GATT link dies with the process; so does
 * the socket, and so does the retry loop that would rebuild them. On a Vivo, an
 * Oppo, a Xiaomi or a Transsion phone, one swipe on the Recents screen ends the
 * process with `kill -9`, and from that moment the wearer is carrying a band
 * that cannot reach anybody.
 *
 * This was the path that did not need us. The band puts an SOS flag in its
 * advertisement, Android's Bluetooth controller matches it against a filter we
 * registered with the *system*, and the OS starts the app to deliver it. See
 * `modules/nigraan-bandwake/.../BandWake.kt` for why each piece is shaped the
 * way it is, and `nigraan_band_nrf52.ino` for the six bytes on the wire.
 *
 * Everything here degrades to a no-op rather than throwing. The module is
 * Android-only and lives in the app binary, so it is absent in Expo Go and on
 * web, and a safety feature that takes the app down when it is missing is worse
 * than one that is missing.

/**
 * The one switch. `false` disables the band's beacon wake everywhere in JS.
 *
 * The Kotlin side has its own — `BandWake.FEATURE_ENABLED` — and it has to be
 * flipped too. Two switches rather than one because they guard different
 * things: this one stops the app *asking* to be woken, and the native one stops
 * the OS *delivering* a wake that was registered by an older build, re-armed by
 * `BandWakeBootReceiver` after a reboot, or a Bluetooth toggle. Neither is
 * sufficient alone.

 * a second one -- so callers may fire this on every band-state change without
 * keeping count. Returns null on success, or a reason worth showing.
 *
 * While disabled this *disarms* instead. A phone upgrading from a build that
 * had the feature on carries a live registration in the Bluetooth stack and an
 * `armed` flag in SharedPreferences that `BandWakeBootReceiver` would act on;
 * leaving the call to do nothing would leave both in place. So the one call

 * not sit there re-raising itself on every launch for the rest of the week.
 *
 * `stale` is the native side's judgement that the press is too old to act on
 * unasked (half an hour). It is returned rather than filtered because the
 * wearer still needs telling that it happened; only the automatic escalation is
 * withheld.
 *
 * While disabled this returns null without reading storage. A pending press
