 * U2 — the client state machine.
 *
 * Every band event and every socket message lands here and produces exactly
 * one transition. The alternative -- an `if` chain per screen -- is how the
 * same mode ends up half-armed in two places, which is the bug class this
 * file exists to make impossible.
 *
 * The design rule, from the execution plan: **the phone is an actuator, never
 * a timekeeper.** Deadlines belong to the server. `checkin.due_at` is stored
 * here so the UI can render a countdown, but nothing in this file decides that
 * a deadline has passed; the sweeper does, and it tells us.
 *
 * The one deliberate exception is `fall_pending`. A fall countdown must be
 * cancellable *before* an alert exists, so there is nothing on the server yet
 * to own it. Thirty seconds of local clock is the price of "I'm fine" working
 * at all, and the alert it raises afterwards is server-owned like every other.
 *
 * High Alert is a mode, not a moment: it is armed in `context.highAlert` and
 * it is also the state the machine rests in, so a check-in that comes and goes
 * returns to `high_alert` rather than to `idle`.
