/**
 * The security PIN (matrix #16). Historically the disarm PIN, and the storage
 * key still says so.
 *
 * High Alert exists for the walk home that somebody else might be watching.
 * If a phone taken out of your hand can switch it off with one tap, the mode
 * protects nobody -- so disarming asks for four digits, and arming never does.
 * Arming must stay free: a control you have to authenticate into is a control
 * you do not use when you are frightened.
 *
 * The same four digits now stand in front of removing somebody from the family
 * list, on the same reasoning: it is the other way to make this phone stop
 * calling for help, it takes effect in both directions immediately, and nobody
 * is told it happened. Adding family is not gated for the same reason arming
 * is not.
 *
 * NOT the band's PIN. That one is six digits, lives in `bandIdentity.js` under
 * `nigraan.band.pin`, and is forgotten on a deliberate disconnect -- a rule
 * this file has nothing to do with. Two separate secrets with two separate
 * lifetimes, and `bandIdentity.js` says why they must never be merged.
 *
 * Note for callers building a gate: `verifyPin` answers TRUE when nothing has
 * been stored, deliberately -- see below. A screen that means "prove it" has to
 * check `hasPin()` first and ask for one to be set, or it will let anybody
 * through.
 *
 * Stored in the platform keystore when it is available, falling back to the
 * same AsyncStorage the session token already lives in. That fallback is worth
 * being honest about: it is device-local and unencrypted, so it stops the
 * person holding your phone, not someone with a forensic image of it. That is
 * the threat this feature is actually about.
 *
 * Device-local also means device-only: nothing is kept on the server, so a
 * reinstall or a new handset starts with no PIN at all. Carrying it across is a
 * separate job, and it wants a hash held against the account -- never the
 * digits. This PIN is only ever compared, never read back, which is exactly
 * what makes it the opposite case from the band PIN escrow.
 */

/**
 * THE KEYS, AND WHY THEY CARRY AN ACCOUNT.
 *
 * These were three bare constants, which made the PIN belong to the HANDSET
 * rather than to the person. That forced sign-out to delete it: leave it, and
 * the next account to sign in on this phone inherits a four-digit gate nobody
 * on it knows, standing in front of its own High Alert disarm and its own
 * family list.
 *
 * The cost of that was paid by the ordinary case. Signing out and back in on
 * your own phone threw your PIN away without saying so, and the first you heard
 * of it was High Alert disarming on one tap because there was no longer
 * anything to ask for -- a gate that quietly stops being a gate, which is worse
 * than one that was never there.
 *
 * An account in the key answers both at once. Two people on one phone get two
 * PINs that cannot see each other, and neither has to be destroyed for the
 * other to be safe. So nothing here is cleared at sign-out any more: the only
 * things that remove a PIN are the wearer asking for it in Settings, and
 * uninstalling the app.

 * THE ATTEMPT LIMIT, and why it had to leave the sheet.
 *
 * `PinSheet` counted three wrong tries and then disabled its keypad -- but it
 * reset that counter every time it closed. Three guesses, close the sheet,
 * three more, forever. Four digits is ten thousand combinations and this is a
 * person holding a phone with nothing else to do, so the limit was decoration.
 *
 * It matters more than it used to. This same gate stands in front of disarming
 * High Alert, removing somebody from the family, and now revealing what the
 * band will accept -- and the first two are exactly what a person who has taken
 * this phone wants. So the count is persisted, and the wait escalates.
 *
 * Three free attempts, then 30s, 2min, and 5min from there on. At three tries
 * per five minutes, walking all ten thousand takes about eleven days of
 * uninterrupted work, which is enough to make it not worth starting.
 *
 * The ceiling is deliberately low. This gate's other job is letting a
 * frightened person turn High Alert off, and a lockout measured in hours would
 * be this app holding its own user hostage. Five minutes stops a search without
 * ever becoming that.
 *
 * The counter carries an account for the same reason the PIN does, and
 * switching accounts is not a way around it: that needs a password the person
 * this limit exists to stop does not have.
