/**
 * HOW FAST WAS THIS PERSON MOVING WHEN THEY WERE HIT.
 *
 * The band measures an impact and cannot say what it was. On a wrist, 11 g is a
 * crash, a clap, a door, or a hand put down hard on a table, and no amount of
 * cleverness in the firmware separates those -- the accelerometer genuinely
 * cannot tell. What separates them is one fact the band has no way to know and
 * this file does: an 11 g spike at walking pace is furniture, and the same
 * spike ten seconds into a 45 km/h ride is a road accident.
 *
 * So this is the other half of the detector. It keeps a short history of how
 * fast the phone has been travelling, and `classifyImpact` is where that
 * history turns a measurement into a decision.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE STOP IS NOT THE TRIGGER
 *
 * The obvious design is "travelling, then a bang, then stopped dead -- that is
 * a crash". It is obvious and it is wrong, in the direction that costs a life.
 *
 * A car that is hit does not reliably stop. It spins, it is pushed down the
 * road, it rolls, it carries on with a concussed driver still holding the
 * wheel, it is shunted into traffic by whatever hit it. A motorbike goes down
 * and slides forty metres. If the detector waits for the speed to reach zero,
 * every one of those is a crash it decides did not happen -- silently, with
 * nobody ever told the question was even asked.
 *
 * So the trigger is the IMPACT AT SPEED, on its own. The stop is used only to
 * decide how long to wait for an answer and what to call the thing in the
 * message. Coming to a halt is corroboration; not coming to a halt is not
 * evidence of anything.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY MOVING AGAIN *DOES* CANCEL, AND WHAT IT HAS TO LOOK LIKE
 *
 * The mirror of that worry is the pothole: a rider hits one at 50 km/h, the
 * wrist sees 12 g, and they ride on perfectly fine. Asking them to answer a
 * check-in is asking somebody to tap a wristband one-handed at speed, which is
 * worse than the false alarm it prevents. So resumed travel does stand the
 * question down.
 *
 * But "moving" is not the test, because a wreck moves. The test is
 * RESUME_STABLE_MS of CONTINUOUS travel above VEHICLE_KMH with no further
 * impact -- because a vehicle held at a steady road speed for twenty unbroken
 * seconds is a vehicle somebody conscious is driving. A car spinning, coasting,
 * rolling or being pushed is losing speed the whole time and breaks the run;
 * so does a bike sliding down the road; so does a second impact. The rule is
 * deliberately about *sustained and coherent* motion rather than about the
 * speedometer being off zero, and that is the entire difference between it and
 * the naive version.
 *
 * If the run breaks, the question stays open and the deadline the server is
 * holding does the rest.
