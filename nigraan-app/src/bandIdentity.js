/**
 * THE BAND'S PIN, AND WHAT THE WEARER CALLS IT.
 *
 * Six digits, and a different secret from the four-digit disarm PIN in
 * `security.js`. They are not the same thing and must never be merged:
 *
 *   the disarm PIN   protects the wearer FROM the phone in someone else's
 *                    hand. It is four digits because it is typed under stress,
 *                    on a keypad that has to leave the cancel button visible.
 *
 *   the band PIN     protects the band FROM everybody else's phone. It is six
 *                    because BLE says so -- `BLE_GAP_PASSKEY_LEN` is 6, and
 *                    this exact string is what Android's pairing dialog asks
 *                    for and what the firmware then wants again over the
 *                    encrypted link.
 *
 * Storing it at all is a deliberate trade. The alternative is asking for six
 * digits every time the band reconnects, and the band reconnects on its own
 * after every walk out of range, every app kill and every reboot -- a safety
 * device that needs typing into before it works is a safety device that is off
 * when it is needed. So it goes in the keystore and the reconnect stays silent.
 *
 * The name is not a secret and lives in plain AsyncStorage. It is only a cache:
 * the band tells us its real name in `auth_ok`, and the band is always right --
 * it may have been renamed from another phone in the family.
