 * Android 16 makes edge-to-edge mandatory, so the app draws underneath the

 * behind the back/home buttons.
 *
 * react-native-safe-area-context measures that bar properly, but an APK built
 * before it was added does not contain the native module -- and that APK still
 * loads this JavaScript from Metro. require() is no help there: it resolves out
 * of node_modules whether or not the binary was built with the module, so the
 * JS loads and the crash lands later, when Fabric looks up the
 * 'RNCSafeAreaProvider' view manager. Asking the native registry directly is
 * the check that matches the binary. It runs once at import time and falls back
 * to a constant that clears both gesture and three-button navigation. The
 * reference never changes between renders, so the hook below keeps a stable
 * call order.
