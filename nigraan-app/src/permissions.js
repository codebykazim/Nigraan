/**
 * THE PERMISSION LADDER, once, for both shells.
 *
 * This lived inside the admin Setup screen, and only there. The end-user shell
 * -- the one an actual wearer signs into -- shipped with no permission screen
 * at all: it got notifications when something tried to post one, and location
 * when the foreground service started, and nothing else was ever asked for. So
 * a fresh account on a stock Android 14 phone had:
 *
 *   - no USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT, which is the whole lock-screen takeover. It
 *     does not fail when missing, it silently downgrades to a heads-up
 *     notification, so "the screen call when the phone is off" simply did not
 *     happen and nothing anywhere said why.
 *   - no battery exemption and no vendor autostart, which is how the watch
 *     stops the first time the phone gets warm.
 *
 * None of that is admin diagnostics. It is the difference between the product
 * working and the product looking like it works, so it belongs to whoever is
 * wearing the thing. The copy lives here so both screens say the same words,
 * and the OEM table has one home rather than two that drift.

 *     Settings before they have seen the app is how they leave. The Home
 *     screen asks for it in place, once there is something to explain.
