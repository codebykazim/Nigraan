/**
 * One way to raise an alarm, three things it might actually do.
 *
 * On a development or production build this is the native module: a real
 * full-screen intent over the lock screen, and a looping siren on the alarm
 * stream (N3.3 + N3.4). In Expo Go and on web the native module is absent, and
 * this degrades to the repeating vibration the app already used -- which is not
 * a lock-screen takeover and is not pretended to be. `alarmCapability()` says
 * which one is in force, so the Setup screen can show it rather than leave
 * somebody to discover the difference during an emergency.
 *
 * Everything here is deliberately failure-tolerant. An alarm that throws is an
 * alarm that did not sound, so each path is wrapped and the vibration fallback
 * runs regardless of what the native side did.
