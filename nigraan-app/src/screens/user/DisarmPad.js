/**
 * What a fall or an accident looks like on the end user's phone.
 *
 * The admin build shows a countdown with a plain "I'M FINE" button, which is
 * right for a console being demonstrated. This is the wearer's phone, and the
 * thing it has to survive is being in a pocket against a body that is not
 * moving on purpose.
 *
 * Nothing on this screen delays dispatch. The timer keeps running while
 * anything is being pressed, and "send emergency now" is one tap away for the
 * whole window.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE PIN IS GONE, AND WHY
 *
 * This screen used to be a four-digit PIN pad. The reasoning was sound for the
 * threat it was written against -- a phone that cancels its own alert in a
 * pocket, or somebody else cancelling it after taking it off you -- and it was
 * the wrong answer for the event that actually reaches this screen.
 *
 * Only a fall or an accident renders this. In both, the person being asked to
 * type four digits has just hit the ground. They may be elderly. They may be
 * face down, one-handed, without their glasses, shaken, in the dark, in the
 * rain. And the penalty for not managing it in forty-five seconds is not a
 * locked phone -- it is a false emergency sent to everybody who cares about
 * them, which is the exact outcome the countdown exists to prevent. **Asking
 * somebody who has just fallen to remember a passcode is asking for the false
 * alarm.**
 *
 * The PIN had also stopped being a gate. The band's single tap answers this
 * question directly (see CHECKIN_CLOSED in App.js), so anyone holding the band
 * could already cancel with one press while the screen demanded a code from
 * the wearer. A control that the primary input path walks straight past is not
 * security, it is an obstacle in front of the one person it was meant to help.
 *
 * ---- what replaces it: a HOLD ----------------------------------------------
 *
 * A press-and-hold of 1.5 s answers the real threat -- a pocket, a sleeve, a
 * body lying on the screen -- because sustained deliberate contact is the one
 * thing incidental pressure does not produce. It needs no memory, no reading,
 * no accuracy, and it works with one hand and with the phone upside down.
 *
 * What is given up, said plainly: somebody who has taken the phone off an
 * injured person can now cancel the countdown by holding a button, where before
 * they needed a code. That is a real loss and it is accepted, because the band
 * tap already made it true, and because the case it protects is far rarer than
 * the case it was breaking. Duress belongs to anti-snatch (v2), which has its
 * own gesture and its own affordance; it does not belong bolted onto a fall.
