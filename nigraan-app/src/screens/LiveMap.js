/**
 * Watching somebody move, without leaving the app.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES. Every "see where they are" in this product opened
 * `https://maps.google.com/?q=<lat>,<lon>`, which is a photograph. The family
 * member taps it during a siren, sees a pin, and that pin is still sitting
 * there twenty minutes later while she is a kilometre away. It cannot be fixed
 * from this side: nothing lets an app push a new position into somebody else's
 * maps app. Google's own live sharing works because Google owns both ends.
 *
 * So the map is the server's own page -- see server/routes/share.py -- and
 * this embeds it. That choice is worth defending, because a native map
 * (react-native-maps) would look better:
 *
 *   - It is ONE map. The same page is what gets forwarded to the police, and
 *     an in-app map built separately would drift from it the first time either
 *     was touched. During an emergency the family and whoever they called must
 *     not be looking at two different answers.
 *   - It needs no Google Maps API key, no billing account, and no native
 *     configuration in a build that already carries plenty.
 *   - The live feed is already solved server-side. Nothing here polls, holds a
 *     socket, or knows what a coordinate is.
 *
 * Swapping the inside for a native map later changes this file and nothing
 * else; the server, the link and the token stay exactly as they are.
 *
 * WHO OWNS WHICH CHROME. The page is a whole product on its own -- it has a
 * heading, a Directions link and a Share button, because the person opening it
 * in a browser has nothing else. Embedded, all three landed directly underneath
 * this screen's own, so the name appeared twice and there were two Directions
 * buttons and two Shares stacked on one phone. Everything below is the native
 * side of that split: the app draws the identity and the actions, because it
 * can hand the coordinates to whichever navigation app the phone's owner
 * actually uses and open the system share sheet, and it asks the page for the
 * map alone with `?embed=1`. The page keeps the one claim only it can make --
 * how old the fix on screen is -- because it is the side that polls.
 *
 * DEGRADES RATHER THAN BREAKS. react-native-webview is loaded the way every
 * optional native module in this app is loaded -- inside a try, at module
 * scope -- so a build that does not have it yet falls back to the old static
 * pin instead of showing a white screen during an emergency. That is not
 * defensive habit: this screen is reached by somebody who has just been woken
 * by a siren, and "the map did not load" must never be the thing standing
 * between them and an address.

/**
 * The same hiding the server does for `?embed=1`, applied from this side too.
 *
 * The app and the server ship on their own schedules. A phone carrying this
 * screen can talk to a server that predates `?embed=1`, and that server has no
 * idea the parameter means anything -- FastAPI drops unknown query params
 * without complaint -- so it serves the page whole: its heading under this
 * screen's heading, its Directions and Share under this screen's DIRECTIONS
 * and SEND LINK. Two of everything, on the one screen somebody reached by
 * being woken with a siren.
 *
 * So the request is not the only thing asking. The rules below are the server's
 * `_EMBED_CSS` verbatim, injected into whatever page comes back, which makes
 * the layout correct against every server version rather than only current
 * ones. When the server has already done it this changes nothing -- the same
 * declarations, applied twice.
 *
 * `#who` is left overridable on purpose, exactly as the server leaves it: the
 * page reveals that heading with an inline style to say the link has ended,
 * which is the one thing it knows and this app does not. `!important` here
 * would silence that message.
