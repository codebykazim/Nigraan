/**
 * The lock-screen takeover and the looping siren (N3.3 / N3.4).
 *
 * `src/alarm.js` is the only caller. It treats this module as optional --
 * `requireOptionalNativeModule` returns null in Expo Go and on web -- and falls
 * back to a plain repeating vibration when it is absent. That fallback is not
 * this feature: it needs the app's JavaScript to still be running, so it dies
 * with the process, which is exactly the case an emergency alarm exists for.
 * Everything below is what survives a killed app.
 *
 * Five decisions carry the design:
 *
 *   1. **The channel is silent and does not vibrate.** A notification channel
 *      plays its sound and its vibration pattern exactly once, and Android
 *      gives no way to loop them. So the channel here is deliberately mute and
 *      still, and the `MediaPlayer` and `Vibrator` below own the audio and the
 *      buzzing instead -- both of which *can* be told to repeat forever.
 *
 *   2. **The audio goes out on `STREAM_ALARM`.** `setBypassDnd(true)` on a
 *      channel is silently ignored unless the app holds Notification Policy
 *      Access, which almost no app has and this one does not ask for. Audio
 *      with `USAGE_ALARM` is exempt from Do Not Disturb by default. The alarm
 *      stream is therefore not a volume preference, it is the DND answer.
 *
 *   3. **`CATEGORY_CALL` + `setFullScreenIntent`.** This is the same pair an
 *      incoming-call screen uses, and it is what makes Android launch the
 *      activity over the keyguard instead of posting a heads-up notification.
 *      The launched activity has to cooperate: `withNigraanAndroid.js` sets
 *      `android:showWhenLocked` and `android:turnScreenOn` on MainActivity, or
 *      the SOS comes up behind the lock screen with the display still off.
 *
 *   4. **The notification carries the two answers itself.** A full-screen
 *      intent is only launched when the phone is locked or its screen is off.
 *      Android's own rule -- "the system UI may choose to display a heads-up
 *      notification instead, while the user is using the device" -- means that
 *      a family member holding an unlocked phone never gets the takeover, no
 *      matter how the permission is set. That is not a failure to fix, it is
 *      the platform, so the notification has to be answerable where it lands:
 *      `CallStyle` renders it as an incoming call with an answer and a decline,
 *      and those two buttons do exactly what the two buttons on the in-app
 *      takeover do. Without them an ongoing, non-swipeable notification with a
 *      siren behind it is a phone the person cannot make stop.
 *
 *   5. **The alert id rides on every intent.** A full-screen intent is not a
 *      notification tap, so `expo-notifications` never sees it and
 *      `subscribeNotificationTaps` never fires. `consumeLaunchAlertId()` is how
 *      a launch -- cold or warm -- learns which emergency woke it, and
 *      `activeAlertId()` is how an app opened some other way finds the siren
 *      that is already sounding.
