/**
 * THE SOS THAT ARRIVES WITH THE APP ALREADY DEAD.
 *
 * A GATT link is opened by the phone and only lives while some app is alive to
 * hold it. On most non-Samsung Android skins -- Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi, Huawei,
 * Transsion -- swiping the app off the Recents screen runs `kill -9` on the
 * process, which no foreground service and no permission survives. We have a
 * logcat of exactly that: `com.vivo.upslide ... kill -9 9457`, and the band
 * dropping six milliseconds later because its GATT client died with us. From
 * that moment the wearer carries a band that looks linked, is not, and will
 * drop their SOS on the floor.
 *
 * Android 8.0 added the one mechanism that answers this:
 * `BluetoothLeScanner.startScan(filters, settings, PendingIntent)`. The scan is
 * owned by the **system**, not by us. The filter is pushed down into the
 * Bluetooth controller, and when a matching advertisement appears the OS starts
 * our process to deliver it. Like an AlarmManager alarm, it outlives `kill -9`.
 *
 * Three properties of it decide everything in this file:
 *
 *   1. **The filter is not an optimisation, it is the permit.** Since Android
 *      8.1 a background scan with no filter returns nothing at all while the
 *      screen is off -- which is precisely when this has to work. Filtering in
 *      the controller is what makes a screen-off background scan legal, and it
 *      is also why being armed costs no battery: the band only advertises the
 *      SOS pattern during an emergency, so in normal use nothing ever matches
 *      and the CPU is never woken.
 *
 *   2. **The PendingIntent must be mutable on Android 12+.** The Bluetooth
 *      stack delivers results by writing them into the intent as extras. With
 *      FLAG_IMMUTABLE it cannot, and the scan then delivers empty broadcasts
 *      forever -- registered, running, and useless. That is the failure that
 *      looks most like success.
 *
 *   3. **It does not survive a reboot, or Bluetooth being switched off and on
 *      again.** It survives the app dying, which is the case it exists for, but
 *      not those two. `BandWakeBootReceiver` re-arms on both.
 *
 * Everything here hangs off an object and takes a Context, rather than living
 * on the Expo module, because the callers that matter have neither a module
 * instance nor a React context: a BroadcastReceiver the system built a
 * millisecond ago, in a process that had been dead since yesterday.

object BandWake {

  /**
   * THE SWITCH. `false` means this phone is never woken by the band.
   *
   * Turned off on purpose on 1 Sep 2026 -- nothing below is deleted, and
   * flipping this back to `true` (with `BAND_WAKE_ENABLED` in
   * `src/bandWake.js`, and the commented-out effects in App.js) restores the
   * feature exactly as it was. The reasoning is in docs/BAND_WAKE_DISABLED.md;
   * the short version is BUG-012 and BUG-013, which are Critical and which need
   * a band id in the advertisement -- new firmware in the field -- before the
   * wake can be trusted with more than one band in the room.
   *
   * This switch is separate from the JavaScript one, and both are needed. The
   * JS one stops the app *asking* to be woken. This one stops the *system*
   * delivering a wake that no JavaScript ever asked for: a registration left in
   * the Bluetooth stack by an earlier build, or one put back by
   * `BandWakeBootReceiver` after a reboot, an app update or a Bluetooth toggle.
   * Those paths run in a process with no React context and would not see the JS
   * switch at all.
