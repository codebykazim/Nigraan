/**
 * The JavaScript face of the band-SOS wake. `src/bandWake.js` is the only caller.
 *
 * Thin on purpose. Everything that has to work with the app dead lives on
 * `BandWake` and in `BandWakeReceiver`, because this class only exists while
 * there is a React context -- which is exactly the condition the whole feature
 * is built to survive the absence of.
 *
 * What this adds on top is the live path. While JS is running there is no
 * reason to make the wearer look at a notification: `onBandSos` hands the press
 * straight to `App.js`, which raises it through the same `raise()` every other
 * SOS goes through. The notification is what happens when this module is not
 * loaded at all.

     * would otherwise take the notification route while the app was in fact
