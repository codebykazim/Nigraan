/**
 * Where the band's SOS lands when there is no app left to land in.
 *
 * The system creates this object fresh, in a process it has just started for
 * the purpose, with no Activity, no React context and no JavaScript. Everything
 * it needs is static on `BandWake` for exactly that reason.
 *
 * It has roughly ten seconds of execution time and no network guarantees, so it
 * does not try to reach the server itself. It does the two things that must
 * happen inside that window -- write the press down where a later launch will
 * find it, and get the phone to wake somebody -- and leaves the actual alert to
 * the app's ordinary `raise()` path, which already owns the GPS fix, the
 * offline queue, the retry and the family fan-out. Reimplementing any of that
 * here would mean two code paths for one alert, and the emergency one would be
 * the one nobody ever tests.
 *
 * Two ways out, and which one is taken depends on whether anything is alive:
 *
 *   - **JavaScript is running.** `BandWake.liveListener` is set, the press goes
 *     straight to it, the alert leaves immediately and nothing is displayed.
 *     This is the case where the band went out of range rather than the app
 *     being killed.
 *
 *   - **The app is dead.** A full-screen-intent notification, the same
 *     mechanism `nigraan-alarm` uses for an incoming family emergency. On a
 *     locked or idle phone -- a phone in a pocket, which is the whole scenario
 *     -- Android launches the activity itself and the app sends the SOS with
 *     nobody touching anything. On a phone being actively used Android shows it
 *     as a heads-up instead, and SEND IT NOW is one tap.
