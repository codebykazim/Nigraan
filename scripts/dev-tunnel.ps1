    NIGRAAN -- DEV TUNNEL

    Brings up the local server and a public HTTPS tunnel to it, then prints the
    one address that goes into the phones.

        powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\dev-tunnel.ps1

    Why a tunnel rather than "just use the same Wi-Fi":

      - Phones on mobile data can reach it. Testers do not have to be in the
        room, on your network, or awake at the same time as you.
      - It is HTTPS, so the app talks to it the way it will talk to the cloud.
        The wss:// path, the certificate handling and the "no cleartext"
        Android rule are all exercised now, not discovered on deployment day.
      - University and cafe Wi-Fi almost always has client isolation on, which
        silently breaks phone-to-laptop on the same SSID. This does not care.

    Free-tier URLs rotate on every restart, which means re-pasting the address
    into every phone each morning. Reserve a domain at dashboard.ngrok.com (the
    free plan includes one) and pass it as -Domain, or set it once and forget:

        setx NIGRAAN_NGROK_DOMAIN overcoat-quizzical-chatty.ngrok-free.dev

    Either way the app stores the address rather than baking it in, so a rotated
    URL is recoverable -- paste the new one on the Auth screen and carry on.

param(
    # A reserved ngrok domain, so the address in the phones never changes.

    #
    #     NIGRAAN_NGROK_DOMAIN=overcoat-quizzical-chatty.ngrok-free.dev

    # With no domain at all the tunnel gets a random address, and every phone
    # has to be re-pasted after each restart.
