# NIGRAAN -- remote deploy, run ON THE SERVER as root.
#
# This is the canonical source of this script -- it lives in the repo so a
# change to it goes through review like anything else. But the copy that
# actually runs is a manually-placed one at /opt/nigraan/deploy.sh, owned by
# root, OUTSIDE the auto-pulled app checkout. That split is deliberate, not
# an oversight -- see docs/AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md section 16.2 ("why deploy.sh is
# not inside the checkout it deploys"). In short: this script runs with root
# privilege (systemctl, package install), and the checkout it pulls is
# whatever landed on `main`. If this file lived inside that checkout, a merge
# to main could rewrite what runs as root on the box -- silently turning
# "can merge code" into "has root on the server". Keeping it outside means a
# change here always needs a human with sudo to copy it into place.
#
# Invoked as:  sudo /opt/nigraan/deploy.sh <sha-for-the-log-line>
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. fetch + hard-reset the app checkout to origin/main
#   2. reinstall dependencies (as the nigraan user, into its venv)
#   3. apply migrations (idempotent by construction -- see migrate_pg.py)
#   4. restart the service
#   5. poll /health; if it never comes up, roll the CODE back and restart
#
# What is NOT rolled back: a migration that already ran. migrate_pg.py's own
# files are written idempotent, so re-applying them after a code rollback is
# a no-op -- there is no automatic "undo" for a schema change, by design, the
# same way there wasn't one when this was run by hand.
