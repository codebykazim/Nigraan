# Bench bring-up — XIAO nRF52840 Sense

Breadboard tests that run **before** `nigraan_band_nrf52/` exists. Each one
isolates a single unknown, so a failure tells you exactly what is broken.
Run them in order and do not skip ahead on a failure.

Covers milestone **F1** and de-risks **F2 / F3 / F4** in
[DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md](../docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md).

**Solder the headers first.** The XIAO ships with them loose. A cold joint on
`3V3` or `GND` presents exactly like a firmware bug.

**No port in Tools → Port?** Double-tap the reset button quickly. The red LED
fades in and out and a `XIAO-SENSE` drive mounts — that is the bootloader. Use
this any time a bad sketch locks the board up.

### Every sketch needs `#include <Adafruit_TinyUSB.h>`

On this core USB CDC lives in a separate library, so without that include
`Serial` does not link:

```
undefined reference to `Adafruit_USBD_CDC::begin(unsigned long)'
undefined reference to `Serial'
```

It ships with the core — nothing to install, but it must be in **every** sketch
that uses `Serial`, including `nigraan_band_nrf52/` when you write it.

## Verified against the installed core

`Seeeduino:nrf52@1.1.13`, `Seeed Arduino LSM6DS3@2.0.7`, FQBN
`Seeeduino:nrf52:xiaonRF52840Sense`. All four sketches compile clean.

Real macro names from
`packages/Seeeduino/hardware/nrf52/1.1.13/variants/Seeed_XIAO_nRF52840_Sense/variant.h`:

| Purpose | Macro | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Onboard LED (active LOW) | `LED_BUILTIN` / `LED_RED` | 11 |
| IMU power gate | `PIN_LSM6DS3TR_C_POWER` | 15 |
| IMU interrupt (F3 wake-on-motion) | `PIN_LSM6DS3TR_C_INT1` | 18 |
| Battery divider enable | `VBAT_ENABLE` | 14 |
| Battery ADC | `PIN_VBAT` | 32 |
| PDM mic | `PIN_PDM_PWR` / `_CLK` / `_DIN` | 19 / 20 / 21 |

> **`EXECUTION_PLAN.md:512` will not compile.** It writes `PIN_VBAT_ENABLE`;
> the macro is `VBAT_ENABLE`. Fix when doing **F2.3**.

> ### `VBAT_ENABLE` must stay LOW. HIGH or high-Z destroys the board.
>
> The divider is `BAT+ — 1M — P0.31 — 510k — P0.14`, so `VBAT_ENABLE` (P0.14) is
> its **bottom** leg. LOW completes the path and is what keeps P0.31 safely
> divided. Set it HIGH, or leave it high-Z as an `INPUT`, and there is no
> division: P0.31 floats toward `BAT+` through the 1 M — ~4.2 V while charging,
> against a **3.6 V absolute maximum**. The pin is permanently destroyed. Seeed

>
> The tempting power saving — *"the divider drains current, gate it between
> readings"* — is exactly the fatal move. That drain is 4.2 V / 1.51 MΩ ≈
> **2.8 µA**, under 1.5% of the F4.3 budget. Leave the pin LOW forever.

**I²C:** `Wire` is the external D4/D5 header. The IMU sits on the internal bus,
`Wire1` (pins 17/16). The Seeed library handles this itself with an internal
`#define Wire Wire1`, so `LSM6DS3 imu(I2C_MODE, 0x6A)` is correct as written —
no bus argument needed.

**On the mic:** the PDM pins *are* defined in this non-mbed variant, so the mic
is more reachable than "mbed only" suggests. It remains a v2 item for a power
reason, not a core reason — continuous listening is ~3–5 mA against a 200–400 µA
budget, which is 1–2 days of battery instead of 1–2 weeks.

## Wiring

Everything is USB powered. **No battery on the breadboard** — except **T8**,
which is the battery test and cannot run without a cell on the BAT pads.

| Motor module | XIAO | |
|---|---|---|
| `IN` | `D1` | |
| `VCC` | `3V3` | not 5V — see below |
| `GND` | `GND` | |
| — | — | 100 µF electrolytic across the module's VCC/GND, stripe leg to GND |

| Button | XIAO |
|---|---|
| one leg | `D2` |
| diagonally opposite leg | `GND` |

A 6×6 tactile has four legs in two permanently-shorted pairs. Pick **diagonal**
legs and the pair cannot be wrong. No pull-up resistor — `INPUT_PULLUP` does it.

### The motor module already has its driver

The 3-pin module carries the transistor, its base resistor and the flyback
diode on board. **Do not fit the 2N2222 / 1 kΩ / 1N4148.** Driving `IN` from a
GPIO is correct here — the pin only feeds a base resistor.

This makes the "never drive the motor from a GPIO pin" warnings in
`README.md:41`, `EXECUTION_PLAN.md:596` and `F4.1` **stale for this part**. They
remain correct for a bare coin motor, which is what you would fit if the module
is too bulky for the wrist enclosure.

The 100 µF is still required. Motor inrush is ~5× running current for a few ms;
without the bulk cap it sags the 3V3 rail and browns out the radio mid-notify.
*If the band disconnects whenever it buzzes, that cap is what's missing.*

### Why 3V3 and not the 5V pin

There is no 5 V on battery — the shipped band runs off a LiPo through the 3V3
rail. Test at the voltage you ship at, or the bench result means nothing. 5 V
would also over-drive a 3 V coin motor.

## The tests

| | Sketch | Wiring | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|
| **T1** | [t1_blink](t1_blink/) | none | Red LED ~1 Hz, `tick` on serial |
| **T2** | [t2_motor](t2_motor/) | motor | Three distinct patterns you can feel, matching the log |
| **T3** | [t3_button_motor](t3_button_motor/) | motor + button | Buzz at 3 s, double-buzz at 5 s, timings match a stopwatch |
| **T4** | [t4_imu](t4_imu/) | none | `IMU OK`, az ≈ 1.00 g flat, `mag` spikes when shaken |
| **T6** | [t6_ble](t6_ble/) | none | `Nigraan-01` in nRF Connect, heartbeat notifies, writes echo back |
| **T7** | [t7_fall_tuning](t7_fall_tuning/) | none | Not a pass/fail test — a **measuring instrument**. See below |
| **T8** | [t8_battery](t8_battery/) | **LiPo on the BAT pads** | `chg` flips within a second of plugging USB in; `mv` agrees with a meter |

**T1 before you wire anything.** It proves the core, board selection, port and
upload path while there is nothing else to blame.

**T7 is different from the other six.** They answer "is this hardware
working"; T7 answers "is this *threshold* right", which has no pass line —
only numbers and a judgement. Run it after T4 passes, whenever a fall
threshold is in question, and before believing any of them.

It runs the **shipping** state machines with the **shipping** constants, and
narrates every stage. That matters because
[`nigraan_band_nrf52.ino`](../nigraan_band_nrf52/nigraan_band_nrf52.ino)
is silent about a near miss: "I dropped it and nothing happened" reads
identically to "the IMU is dead". T7 tells you which of the three stages
rejected the attempt and by how much, so you know which number to move and
in which direction.

```
  SHOCK  [##########      ]  peak 11.40 g   spin 512 deg/s   lasted 180 ms
         impact threshold 8.00 g -> the band WOULD send `impact` to the phone.

  REJECTED at stage 3: hit hard enough (6.80 g) but never stayed still.
             Longest quiet run was 420 ms, needs 1600 ms.
```

Throw it at a wall, wear it and jump off a chair, roll off the bed with it
on — every one of those prints a verdict. Type `h` for the thresholds, `c`
for raw CSV to plot, `s` for a session summary.

**T2/T3:** hold the coin motor between two fingers — on a desk it just skitters.
**Tape it down**, or it will vibrate jumper wires out of the breadboard and you
will blame the code.

**T3** fires its haptic *when the threshold is crossed*, not on release. That is
the real interaction model: in a snatching the user cannot look at a screen, so
the wrist must confirm the gesture while their thumb is still down.

**T4** needs no wiring — the IMU is on the board. The catch is the power gate at
`P1.08`: the Sense can switch the IMU off entirely for low power, and until you
drive that pin HIGH, `begin()` fails on perfectly good hardware. The section 8
skeleton in `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` is missing that line.

**T8** covers **F2.3** and is the only test that needs the cell. Two separate
signals: the charge bit is the BQ25100's open-drain `~CHG` on **D23 / P0.17** —
active LOW, `INPUT_PULLUP` or it reads as noise — and the level is the P0.31
divider through the shipping LiPo curve. `variant.h` has no macro for `~CHG`;
the pin map in `variant.cpp` is where it is written down.

*"Not charging" has two causes.* `~CHG` only reports current flowing, so a
topped-off cell on USB reads identically to one running on battery. The `mv`
column is what separates them. And `pct` reads optimistically high for as long
as the charger is on, because charge current lifts terminal voltage — so
**calibrate with USB unplugged**, never while charging.

That calibration is the real reason to run it. `VBAT_DIVIDER_COMP` is a nominal
1M/510k ratio in both this sketch and the shipping firmware — carried with a
`VERIFY` on it and never actually measured, while the app's low-battery warning
rides on it. T8 prints
the raw ADC average next to the volts so the correction is one multiplication
from a scrollback — then change it in **both** places.

## Open — haptic strength (deferred, not resolved)

The buzz is weaker than it should be. **Current setting: steady 1500 ms**, which
tested stronger than every pulse train in [t5_haptic_patterns](t5_haptic_patterns/) —
the opposite of how a healthy coin ERM behaves.

That inversion is the symptom worth remembering: pulses of 100–150 ms felt
weaker than one long buzz, which means the motor is spinning up far too slowly
and probably never reaches full speed.

**Measured on this unit: 200 ms is too weak to feel reliably; ~300 ms is the
floor.** A healthy coin ERM reaches usable amplitude in 50–80 ms, so this one is
roughly 4× slow. That is the same slow-spin-up cause as the inversion above, now
with a number on it.

### Why this cannot be fixed by raising the timings

The obvious response — make every pulse 300 ms — quietly destroys the haptic
vocabulary. Every `feedback()` call in
[`nigraan_band_nrf52.ino`](../nigraan_band_nrf52/nigraan_band_nrf52.ino) sits
under the floor:

| Meaning | Current | At a 300 ms floor |
|---|---|---|
| `ack` from cloud | `feedback(1, 60, 60)` | 5× longer |
| check-in ack ("I'm fine") | `feedback(1, 90, 90)` | 3× longer |
| **SOS fired** | `feedback(4, 120, 80)` | 0.7 s → **1.8 s** |
| High Alert on | `feedback(2, 180, 120)` | 0.6 s → **1.2 s** |

> **Three of those four values have since changed** on
> `feat/press-feedback-and-link-led` (1 Sep 2026). `ack` now means "the server
> has it" and buzzes `1 × 400` for an SOS or `2 × 90/70` for a check-in; the old
> `1 × 60/60` is gone, and nothing in the design goes below 90 ms any more. The
> SOS press itself no longer buzzes a confirmation at all — it gets a `1 × 90`

>
> The argument below is unaffected — it is about what a 300 ms floor would do to
> *any* set of short patterns, and the new set is shorter still. **The

Two things break. The patterns stop being *distinguishable* — at 300 ms per
pulse with adaptation blunting anything longer, a 1-pulse ack and a 4-pulse SOS
both read as "a long buzz happened." And the SOS confirmation arrives ~1.8 s
after the tap, in the one situation where the wearer cannot wait and cannot
look.

So the 300 ms floor is not a tuning value to adopt. It is the measurement that
says **fix the driver**, because the 100–150 ms design is correct and the
hardware is what is failing to deliver it.

**Leading hypothesis:** the module is built for 5 V logic. If its base resistor
is the 5.1 kΩ part, a 3.3 V GPIO delivers ~0.5 mA of base current — enough to
switch roughly 50 mA, not the 80–100 mA the motor draws. The transistor never
saturates, so the motor runs permanently at partial power.

**The 20-second test, no multimeter:** leave `VCC` on `3V3`, move `IN` off the
GPIO and jumper it straight to the `5V` pin.

| Result | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Noticeably stronger | Base drive is the bottleneck | Drop the module; use BOM items 5/6/7 with the **AO3400 logic-level MOSFET** (no base current, fully on at 3.3 V) |
| About the same | The motor is the ceiling | Component change — larger ERM, or the LRA at `README.md:243` |

With a multimeter: probe across the motor's solder pads while buzzing. ~3.0–3.2 V
means full drive; meaningfully lower confirms the transistor isn't saturating.

> Must be resolved before the enclosure is finalised — one branch changes the
> BOM and brings the discrete driver parts back into the build.

## After T4 passes

Run **T6** — it is the last unknown. T1–T4 prove the board, motor, button and
IMU; T6 proves the radio, and F1.2/F1.3 close with it.

Once T6 passes, F1 is done and every F2 unknown — protocol, haptics, gestures,
radio — is proven. **T6 passed and that port has since landed:**
[`nigraan_band_nrf52.ino`](../nigraan_band_nrf52/nigraan_band_nrf52.ino)
reuses `Button`, `Pattern`, `onGesture` and `handleCommand` verbatim from the
ESP32 prototype with only the `BLEDevice`/`BLEServer` layer rewritten onto
`BLEUart`. The protocol was frozen, so the app never noticed the swap — and the
prototype has now been retired from the tree.

Note these bench sketches use blocking `delay()` in `buzz()`. The shipping
firmware must not — use the non-blocking `feedback()` / `feedbackTick()` pattern
player in the nRF52 sketch (`F4.3`: never `delay()` in `loop()`).
