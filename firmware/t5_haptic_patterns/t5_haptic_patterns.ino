   NIGRAAN — TEST 5: WHICH HAPTIC PATTERN CAN YOU ACTUALLY FEEL?
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Same wiring as T2/T3. Nothing to change.

   Run this with the motor TAPED AGAINST YOUR WRIST, not held in your fingers.
   A coin ERM loose in the air shakes nothing; coupled to flesh it is several
   times stronger. If you only test it pinched between two fingers you will
   reject a motor that would have been fine.

   Two ERM facts that drive every pattern below:

     1. SPIN-UP. The motor needs ~50-80 ms to reach speed. Pulses shorter than
        that never develop real amplitude, so they feel weak no matter how many
        you chain. 100-150 ms is the shortest pulse worth using.

     2. ADAPTATION. Skin stops registering steady vibration within a few hundred
        ms. A 1500 ms continuous buzz does not feel stronger than a 500 ms one --
        it feels the same, for longer. Onsets are what you feel, so more edges
        beats more time.

   Each pattern announces itself on serial, then fires after a 1 s gap so you
   can attend to it. Note which numbers you can feel reliably WITHOUT looking.
   That number is your SOS confirmation pattern.
